    <p>Monster Hunter is a hack and slash, strategy, adventure game, which releasedon PS2 in September 21st 2004 in North America. The game is a simulation fo hunting in a world filled with deadly monsters. With skill and provided items you can successfully kill or capture a monster. Due to no advertising it sold poorly in Europe and America. In its native land, Japan, it was a huge success.</p>
    <h1>Online Multiplayer</h1>
    <p>Like the game was intended to Monster Hunter had a online multiplayer, which lets the player decide between 2 Servers (Red World and Green World) and then a Town Area going from A to Z. In the town there were up to 8 players who then could play quests with up to 4 man.</p>
    <p>Unfortionatly the multiplayer was shut down on PS2 in January 1st, 2008 and so there were less and less hunters because you could do less in offline mode.</p>
